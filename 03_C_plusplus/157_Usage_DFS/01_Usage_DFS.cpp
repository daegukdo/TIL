@ LeetCode - DFS - Template I

As we mentioned in the chapter's description, in most cases, we can also use DFS when using BFS. 

But there is an important difference: the traversal order.

Different from BFS, the nodes you visit earlier might not be the nodes which are closer to the root node. 

As a result, the first path you found in DFS might not be the shortest path.

In this article, we will provide you a recursion template of DFS and show you how the stack helps with this process. 

And then we provide some exercise after this article for you to practice.

Template - Recursion

There are two ways to implement DFS. 

The first one is to do recursion which you might already be familiar with. 

Here we provide a template as reference:
